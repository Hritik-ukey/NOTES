🔹 Basics of Computer Networks

Computer Network: Collection of devices connected to share data/resources.
Example: Office computers sharing one printer via LAN.

Types of Networks:

LAN (Local Area Network): Small area like home/office Wi-Fi.

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): City-wide network like cable TV internet.

WAN (Wide Area Network): Covers countries/continents → Internet.

🔹 IP Addressing

IP Address: Unique address of each device in a network.
Example: Phone gets 192.168.0.5 when connected to Wi-Fi.

IPv4 vs IPv6:

IPv4 → 32-bit, written like 192.168.1.1, limited ~4 billion addresses.

IPv6 → 128-bit, written like 2001:db8::1, virtually unlimited.

MAC Address: Hardware ID of device → permanent.
Example: Laptop Wi-Fi card → 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E.

NAT (Network Address Translation): Converts private IPs → public IP.
Example: Home router hides all devices under one public IP.

DHCP: Auto-assigns IPs to devices.
Example: Your phone gets IP automatically when you join Wi-Fi.

🔹 DNS & Services

DNS (Domain Name System): Converts names → IP addresses.
Example: google.com → 142.250.182.14.

HTTP vs HTTPS: Protocol for web communication, HTTPS = secure with SSL/TLS.
Example: Browsing Facebook securely = HTTPS.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol): For file sharing.
Example: Uploading website files to hosting server.

SMTP/IMAP/POP3: For sending/receiving emails.
Example: Gmail uses SMTP to send, IMAP/POP3 to fetch emails.

🔹 OSI Model (7 Layers)

Think of OSI like sending a letter via postal system.

Physical Layer: Hardware, cables, signals.
Example: Ethernet cable, Wi-Fi signals.

Data Link Layer: MAC addressing, error detection.
Example: Switch forwards frame based on MAC.

Network Layer: Logical addressing, routing.
Example: Router sends packet to correct destination via IP.

Transport Layer: Reliability, segmentation.
Example: TCP ensures message delivery, UDP just sends quickly.

Session Layer: Manages connections (start/close).
Example: Online banking login session.

Presentation Layer: Data translation, encryption.
Example: SSL/TLS encryption for HTTPS.

Application Layer: User-facing apps.
Example: Web browser, email client.

🔹 TCP/IP Model (Practical Internet Model)

Simplified 4 layers (real-world version of OSI).

Link Layer: Hardware, MAC.

Internet Layer: IP addressing, routing.

Transport Layer: TCP/UDP communication.

Application Layer: User applications like HTTP, DNS, FTP.

Example: Sending a WhatsApp message uses all layers — from app down to Wi-Fi signals.

🔹 TCP vs UDP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, connection-oriented, error-checked.
Example: WhatsApp text, email, web browsing (must not lose data).

UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Fast, no reliability, connectionless.
Example: Online gaming, video streaming, Zoom call (speed matters more).

TCP 3-Way Handshake:

SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK.
Example: Like saying “Hello” → “Hello back” → “Okay let’s talk.”

🔹 Switching & Routing

Hub: Broadcasts data to all devices (wastes bandwidth).

Switch: Sends data only to intended device using MAC.

Router: Connects multiple networks, uses IP for routing.
Example: Home router connects LAN to Internet.

🔹 Data Transmission Concepts

Packet Switching: Data broken into packets sent independently.
Example: Internet browsing.

Circuit Switching: Dedicated path for full session.
Example: Traditional phone call.

Bandwidth: Max capacity of link (100 Mbps internet).

Latency: Delay in data transfer (video call lag).

🔹 Network Security

Firewall: Filters network traffic for safety.
Example: Blocks unauthorized access.

Proxy Server: Acts as middleman, can hide IP.
Example: VPN hides your location.

DoS/DDoS Attack: Flooding server with fake traffic.
Example: Website crashes due to attack.

DNS Spoofing: Fake DNS redirects user to wrong site.
Example: Fake bank site steals passwords.

🔹 Classic Problems & Tools

Ping: Command to test connectivity.
Example: ping google.com checks if reachable.

Traceroute: Shows path packets take.
Example: Debugging slow connection.

Producer-Consumer (in Networks): Buffers in routers store packets before sending.
