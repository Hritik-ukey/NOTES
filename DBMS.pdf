Q) Normalization

Reduce redundancy and improve data integrity 

1NF
2NF
3NF
BCNF

Q) ACID Properties 

ATOMICITY : All operations should be executed or none of them should be executed that is there should be a rollback mechanism 

CONSISTENCY : Whenever we r reading any value from the DB it should be up to date writing any value to the DB 
              we should always follow the integrity rule.

INTEGRITY : When two tranisition is occur it should be isolated with other.

DURABILITY : Commited changes are saved in a DB even there is a system crash or any faliure.

Q) Order by Vs Group by

Order by : Order by arrage your data or sort your data in ascending or descending order 
Group by : Aggregate or Group same values in one or more coloumns

Q) Aggregate Function :
   Perform calculation on set of values

   MIN(),MAX(),COUNT(),AVG(),SUM().

Q) JOINS :
A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column (usually a foreign key).  

 INNER JOIN :
 SELECT * FROM Employees
 INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.dept_id = Departments.id;

LEFT JOIN :
SELECT * FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN Departments ON Employees.dept_id = Departments.id;

RIGHT JOIN :
SELECT * FROM Employees
RIGHT JOIN Departments ON Employees.dept_id = Departments.id;

 FULL JOIN :
SELECT * FROM Employees
FULL OUTER JOIN Departments ON Employees.dept_id = Departments.id;


CROSS JOIN :
SELECT * FROM Products
CROSS JOIN Categories;
Used to generate all the combination from both the tables
 (rarely used in real-world apps).


SELF JOIN:

SELECT *
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;

to compare or combine data within the same table,

Q) SUBSTRING()
SELECT SUBSTRING('HelloWorld', 1, 5);  -- Output: 'Hello'

TIME()
âœ… In MySQL: Extracts time part from a datetime
SELECT TIME('2024-05-24 14:35:00');  -- Output: '14:35:00'

SELECT CURRENT_TIME();   -- Output: e.g., '15:42:10'

UPPER() :
SELECT UPPER('chatgpt');  -- Output: 'CHATGPT'

) LIMIT 
LIMIT controls how many rows you get.
Used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query.

 SELECT * FROM Employees
 LIMIT 5;

OFFSET
OFFSET controls where to start from.
Used to skip a specific number of rows before starting to return results.

 SELECT * FROM Employees
 LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;

 This skips the first 10 rows, then returns next 5 rows (i.e., rows 11 to 15).

) B B+ and AVL Tree
  
  B : Balanced multi way searched tree 
      A nodes have more than 2 childrens 
      it maintains its balance by ensuring that all the level 
      of leafe nodes are at the same level making searching,insertion,deletion more efficient.
  
  B+ : Its a varient of B tree only All the data pointers are strored at the leaf Nodes
       for faster serching and indexing.
  
  AVL Tree : A self balance binary search tree always maintain -1,0,1 height of 
             left and right subtree.
