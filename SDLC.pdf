Q. SDLC models phases
SDLC is the process followed to build high-quality software in a structured and efficient way

1. planning 
2. Defining 
3. Designing
4. Building 
5. Testing
6. deployment

Waterfall Model : Oldest, Step-by-Step
Waterfall Model is a linear and sequential SDLC model.
"No going back — changes are hard once a phase is done.

V Shape Model :  Waterfall + Testing at Each Step
V-Model (Validation and Verification Model) is an extension of the Waterfall model
where testing is planned parallel to development.


Iterative Model – Build, Improve, Repeat
Start with a basic version, then improve it in loops (iterations).

Spiral Model :  Risk-Oriented + Iterations
Spiral Model combines iterative development with risk analysis at every phase.
Best used when:
Project is large, complex, and risky.

Agile Model : Fast, Flexible, Team-Driven
Agile Model builds software in small, quick cycles with continuous feedback and improvements.

Fast, frequent updates

Welcomes changes anytime

Involves customer feedback regularly

✅ Used when:
Project needs are unclear or likely to change.
