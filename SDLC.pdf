 What is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?
👉 SDLC is the step-by-step process to build software — like a recipe to make a dish, but for apps/websites/software.

Phases:

Requirement Gathering -> Planning -> Design -> Development -> Testing -> Deployment –> Maintenance. 

📊 SDLC Models in Simple Terms:

1. Waterfall Model – Oldest, Step-by-Step
💡 Simple Idea:
You complete one phase fully, then move to the next — like building a house (you can’t fix the foundation after the roof).

❌ Problem:
If something goes wrong at the end, you can’t go back easily.

2. V-Model (Verification & Validation) – Waterfall + Testing at Each Step
💡 Simple Idea:
For every development phase, there’s a matching testing phase – side-by-side.


3. Iterative Model – Build, Improve, Repeat
💡 Simple Idea:
Start with a basic version, then improve it in loops (iterations).


4. Spiral Model – Risk-Oriented + Iterations
💡 Simple Idea:
Build the product in loops (like a spiral). Each loop involves planning, building, testing, checking risks.


5. Agile Model – Fast, Flexible, Team-Driven
💡 Simple Idea:
Build the product in small parts (called sprints). Get feedback quickly, adapt fast, work in teams.
