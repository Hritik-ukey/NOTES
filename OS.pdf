OS :
An operating system (OS) is essential system software that manages a computer's
hardware and software resources, acting as an intermediary between the user and the computer


) Sheduling Algorithms

It's how the OS decides which process to run next on the CPU.

| Algorithm                     | Preemptive | Description                                         | Example Use Case                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| FCFS (First Come First Serve) | ‚ùå No      | Processes executed in the order they arrive         | Print Queue                           |
| SJF (Shortest Job First)      | ‚ùå / ‚úÖ   | Run process with shortest burst time first          | Batch Jobs                            |
| Round Robin (RR)              | ‚úÖ Yes    | Each process gets fixed time slot (time quantum)     | Time-sharing systems (e.g. OS shells) |
| Priority Scheduling           | ‚ùå / ‚úÖ   | Processes with highest priority are scheduled first  | Real-time systems                     |
| Multilevel Queue              | ‚úÖ Yes     | Different queues for different types of processes    | OS processes vs. user processes       |



) Thread Vs process 


| Feature       | Process                                  | Thread                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Definition    | Independent program in execution         | Smallest unit of execution in a process |
| Memory        | Has its own memory space                 | Shares memory with other threads        |
| Overhead      | High (context switching is costly)       | Low (faster context switching)          |
| Communication | Inter-process Communication (IPC) needed | Shared memory (easier & faster)         |
| Crash Effect  | One process crash won‚Äôt affect others    | Thread crash can affect other threads   |




) How can you Achieve multithreading 

Multithreading is achieved by dividing a program into multiple independent tasks (threads) that can be executed concurrently.
This allows for faster execution of tasks, especially those that are I/O bound or can be parallelized.
Multithreading can be implemented in different ways depending on the programming language and the specific requirements of the application, 
but generally involves creating threads, managing their execution, and ensuring proper synchronization to avoid issues like race conditions. 



 What is a Semaphore ?
A semaphore is a variable (or abstract data type) used to control access to a shared resource in a concurrent system (like multi-threading).

üì¶ Think of it as:
A gatekeeper that controls how many threads can access a resource.

What is Binary Semaphore ? 
A binary semaphore is a synchronization primitive used in computer science to 
control access to shared resources between multiple processes or threads.


Paging and Segmentation.

‚úÖ Paging
üëâ Memory is divided into fixed-size pages to avoid external fragmentation.

‚úÖ Segmentation
üëâ Memory is divided into variable-size segments based on logical divisions like code, stack, data, etc.

üß† Bonus: One-line Difference
üìå Paging is based on size (fixed blocks), while segmentation is based on meaning (logical parts of a program).




ONE SHORT :

üîπ Basics of Operating System

Operating System (OS): Software that acts as a bridge between user and hardware.
Example: Like a hotel manager connecting customers to kitchen, housekeeping, etc.

üîπ Types of OS

Batch OS: Executes jobs in batches without user interaction.
Example: Old payroll systems running salary slips together overnight.

Time-Sharing OS: Multiple users share CPU time simultaneously.
Example: Multiple people logged into a server like Gmail hosting thousands of users.

Distributed OS: Manages multiple computers as one system.
Example: Google servers across the world handling one search.

Real-Time OS (RTOS): Gives output instantly, strict deadlines.
Example: Airbag system in cars, missiles launching system.

üîπ Processes & Threads

Process: A program in execution.
Example: Opening Chrome browser = process.

Thread: Smallest unit of execution inside a process.
Example: Chrome ‚Üí one thread for UI, one for video playback.

Multithreading: Running multiple threads inside one process.
Example: You can scroll while a YouTube video keeps playing.

üîπ CPU Scheduling

Scheduling: Deciding which process gets CPU next.
Example: Like a teacher giving each student a chance to answer.

FCFS (First Come First Serve): Whoever comes first gets CPU first.
Example: Queue at a ticket counter.

SJF (Shortest Job First): CPU goes to the shortest task.
Example: Chef cooking smaller dishes first.

Round Robin: Each process gets fixed time slice (quantum).
Example: Each kid on swing gets 2 minutes turn.

Priority Scheduling: CPU given to process with highest priority.
Example: Emergency patient treated before normal patients.

üîπ Memory Management

Paging: Divide memory into fixed-size blocks (pages).
Example: Book divided into equal-sized pages.

Segmentation: Divide memory based on logic (functions/modules).
Example: Dividing a book into chapters.

Virtual Memory: Use hard disk as extra RAM.
Example: You run big apps ‚Üí laptop uses disk space when RAM is full.

üîπ Deadlock

Deadlock: Two or more processes waiting for each other ‚Üí stuck forever.
Example: Two people crossing a narrow bridge from opposite sides, neither moves back.

Deadlock Conditions (Coffman‚Äôs):

Mutual Exclusion ‚Äì one resource only one process at a time

Hold & Wait ‚Äì process holding one resource waits for another

No Preemption ‚Äì can‚Äôt forcibly take resource

Circular Wait ‚Äì cycle of waiting processes

üîπ File System

File System: Way OS stores/retrieves files.
Example: NTFS, FAT32 in Windows, ext4 in Linux.

üîπ Synchronization

Critical Section: Part of code that only one process should access at a time.
Example: Only one person can use ATM machine at a time.

Semaphore: A signaling mechanism to control access.
Example: Traffic light system controlling cars at junction.

üîπ I/O Management

Spooling: Put tasks in a queue for device processing.
Example: Multiple print jobs stored in queue before printer prints them one by one.


REST OF THE TOPICS :

üîπ Leftover / Important OS Topics

Kernel Types

Monolithic Kernel: All OS services in one big kernel.
Example: Linux.

Microkernel: Minimal core, other services in user space.
Example: Minix, QNX.

System Calls

Interface between user program and OS.
Example: open(), read(), write() in Linux.

Context Switching

Saving state of one process and loading another.
Example: Teacher switching between students answering questions.

Thrashing

Excessive swapping between RAM and disk (system slows down).
Example: Laptop hangs when too many apps open.

Caching

Storing frequently used data for faster access.
Example: Browser cache speeds up website loading.

Fragmentation

Internal: Wasted memory inside allocated block.

External: Wasted memory between free blocks.
Example: Cupboard with gaps that can‚Äôt fit clothes properly.

Interrupts

Hardware/software signal that grabs CPU attention.
Example: Phone ringing while studying (CPU forced to handle call).

Multitasking vs Multiprocessing

Multitasking: CPU switches between tasks.

Multiprocessing: Multiple CPUs run tasks in parallel.

Producer-Consumer Problem (Classic Synchronization Problem)

Producer generates data, consumer uses it ‚Üí need coordination.
Example: Chef (producer) & waiter (consumer) in restaurant.

Banker‚Äôs Algorithm

Deadlock avoidance by checking resource safety.
Example: Bank never gives loan beyond safe limit.
